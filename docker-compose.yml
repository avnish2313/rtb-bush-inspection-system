# Docker Compose configuration for the RTB Bush inspection system.
#
# This file defines two services:
#   - backend: handles hardware control and exposes REST API endpoints.
#   - frontend: provides a web dashboard and proxies requests to the backend.
#
# The services share a custom bridge network so they can resolve each other by
# name (e.g. the frontend can reach the backend at http://backend:5000).

services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    container_name: rtb_backend
    networks:
      - rtbnet
    ports:
      - "5001:5000"  # expose the backend API on host port 5001

  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    container_name: rtb_frontend
    networks:
      - rtbnet
    ports:
      - "8080:5000"  # serve the dashboard on host port 8080
    environment:
      - BACKEND_URL=http://backend:5000  # instruct the frontend where to find the backend service
